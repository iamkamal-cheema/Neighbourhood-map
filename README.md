A beutiful web application made using Google Map Api's along with wikipedia Api's. To address the separation of concerns, knockout.js library is used.

### Installation

### Tech

The application has following integral components:
> The development environment is setup using [yeoman.io](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp#readme)  front-end web app.  
> This simple webapp take away the pain to manually set up the development environment as it uses various tools such as gulp, browser-sync and one-click production ready website.
>  The idea is that everything becomes simple and straight forward as it comes with bootstrap and Jquery preinstalled for you.


After setting the development environment, we can add the kncokout.js library to our project, typing the following in terminal:

```sh
bower install knockout 
```

After this put in the path to knockout.js in your index.html file.Now we are ready to get started.
